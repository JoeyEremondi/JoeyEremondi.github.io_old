Below is a list of software projects I have developed or contributed code to, as well as
packages I maintain:

**Haskelm: Haskell to Elm translation**

This library is allows for unified Algebraic Data Types to be used in both a Haskell backend
and an Elm frontend, seamlessly sent using JSON.

See it on [GitHub](http://github.com/JoeyEremondi/Haskelm) or on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskelm).

**Giraffe: a High-Level Code Visualiser for Beginning Programmers**

Link and downloads to come soon!

My main involvement in Giraffe was implementing a C interpreter in Java. This was not an easy task, and presented many challenges.

**Eskate: a Kinect-enabled XNA platformer**

For CMPT 306, I was part of a group which developed a Kinect-enabled video game using the XNA frameword. The game featured a protagonist riding a skateboard, holding a large stick which could be used to fend off enemies. The movers hand movements were tracked, enabling them to hold an actual stick to control the in-game weapon.**
