I've written a general purpose 3D library for Elm.
I'd consider this an alpha release: most features are there but with some bugs and issues.
Please feel free to try it, test it, or submit suggestions or pull-requests.

The main idea of the library is to provide a very simple 3d interface, a wrapper around webgl,
so that you can assemble scenes without having to worry about shaders or matrix math.

I've got support for textures, lighting, cameras, and bump mapping,
as well as loading of OBJ model files.
There's a fairly detailed example [here](https://github.com/JoeyEremondi/ElmObjParser/blob/master/ObjTest.elm).
You can view the compiled HTML [here](http://eremondi.com/ElmObjParser/ObjTest.html).

The library is on [elm-get](http://library.elm-lang.org/catalog/JoeyEremondi-ElmObjParser/0.4.1),
and [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeyEremondi/ElmObjParser). 

I'll rename it and write a full tutorial before a 1.0 release.

Happy coding!
